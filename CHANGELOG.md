- In case of any errors about XML validation, since KSeF doesn't provide specific feedback on XML validation errors, here's some troubleshooting to catch things (for instance, not including NIP for customer, etc)
  - Download the schemat_FA(3)_v1-0E.xsd from the KSEF-Docs github
  - Download the XML from the submission attempt either in the KSEF Submissions tab or on the invoice KSEF tab.
  - Use xmllint to verify the XML against the schema, for instance xmllint --schema schemat_FA\(3\)_v1-0E.xsd FA3_invoice_2(1).xml  FA3_invoice_1.xml
  - This should provide you specifically what validation check is being failed.
