>- Fix PDF generation error for correction invoices
>- QR code generation was using wrong translation method

>### Version v1.1.0
>- Reverted default to Demo environment instead of Production environment on enabling the module, just to ensure we don't accidentally submit official invoices when testing!)

>- It should work on the day of system going live (1 Feb 2026). Just remember to change the environment to production at this time! (In v1.0 and beyond, after KSeF system is live, we will default to this environment)
>- In case of any errors about XML validation, since KSeF doesn't provide specific feedback on XML validation errors, here's some troubleshooting to catch things (for instance, not including NIP for customer, etc)
>  - Download the schemat_FA(3)_v1-0E.xsd from the KSEF-Docs github
>  - Download the XML from the submission attempt either in the KSEF Submissions tab or on the invoice KSEF tab.
>  - Use xmllint to verify the XML against the schema, for instance xmllint --schema schemat_FA\(3\)_v1-0E.xsd FA3_invoice_2(1).xml  FA3_invoice_1.xml
>  - This should provide you specifically what validation check is being failed.
